It was a cold and stormy day when Jessica entered the building. She was feeling exhausted and tired, unsure of what this meeting will lead to. She didn't care what happened, as long as she got to rest after. Several hours later, her phone pinged. What happened after was utter disbelief. She had got the job she wanted, even though she didn't give it her all. She was shocked that she was able to reach her goal, and celebrated with her friends after.
	That night, instead of resting, Jessica decided to go out and have drinks with her friend. Little did she know that this night will change her life forever. As she was leaving the bar, she noticed a strange man holding a briefcase in the alleyway. Jessica thought nothing of it until the man dropped the briefcase and ran. She approached it cautiously. Upon opening the briefcase she found ten bags of diamonds and a note. The note said "Consider this a signing bonus for your new job".
	She went home with the briefcase in hand, constantly looking behind her worried someone might be there trying to steal her diamonds. When she made it through her front door she sighed, finally safe, or so she thought. When she close the door she finally noticed that standing right beside her was... her mother! Her mother grabbed the briefcase, opened it and snatched the diamonds before Jessica could come to her senses. In a mix of shock and despair Jessica watched as her mother proceeded to run back out the door, with ten bags of diamonds in her arms...
